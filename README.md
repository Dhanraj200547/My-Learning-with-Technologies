#  My Learning with Technologies

Welcome to **My Learning with Technologies** — a personal repository where I practice, experiment, and build skills across multiple programming languages and frameworks.  
This repo serves as my **learning journey** in Python, Java, Machine Learning, and more, with organized folders for different topics and hands-on code.

##  Goal

This repository is not just for storing code — it’s a **continuous learning journal**.
I use it to:

* Practice coding daily.
* Revisit fundamental concepts.
* Experiment with different libraries and frameworks.
* Track my growth as a developer.
